## Overview

The Employee Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of employee accounts within an organization. 
It provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, editing, and deleting user accounts, along with advanced role management capabilities to control access and permissions.
For a quick overview, I have provided a screenshot of the project on the overview.zip file. 

## Key Objectives

- **Simplified User Management:** The system provides a straightforward process for creating, editing, and deleting user accounts. Administrators can easily handle the onboarding of new employees, update information, and manage departures seamlessly.

- **Granular Access Control:** With a sophisticated role management system, the application ensures that users have specific permissions based on their roles. This allows organizations to enforce security measures by restricting access to sensitive data and functionalities.

- **Database Control:** Beyond user management, the system empowers authorized users to control databases. This feature is essential for maintaining the integrity of data, ensuring that only qualified personnel can make changes to critical information.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Easily register new users with necessary information.
- **User Editing:** Update user details as needed.
- **User Deletion:** Remove user accounts when necessary.
- **Role Management:** Assign specific roles to users, controlling their access and permissions.
- **Database Control:** Users with appropriate roles can manage databases, including to view, post, edit, and delete.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL
